			<h2>Application Season</h1>
			<h3>02/05/2016</h3>
			<p>I do not know what happed to my application process. Every day, I become more and more upset. I used to believe that although I was not the best, I deserved a decent school. As day and day passed by, I still got nothing from any graduate school. I began to get annoyed easily and doubt myself. I do not have a paper published inn Top Conference or any internship. It was all of my fault. I got accustomed to pursuing those trival things and became scared of roads that were full of risks. I feel sad for the past three month I have wasted in doing nothing.</p>
			<p>Probably the most urgent action I should take is to prepare for the worst -- Maybe I do not have sufficient money to support my graduate school, or I would be rejected by all the schools I have applied. I should stop being worried and wandering every day. From now on, I have to promise that:
			<li>I would engaged in studying C++ and recovering the basic knowledge, such as algorithm and data structure.</li>
			<li>I would sleep before 00:30 and get up at around 8:00 in the morning.</li>
			<li>I would spend some time in my thesis.</li>
			<li>I should reflect myself in this blog every day and record the progress I make every day.</li>
			Anyway, I should keep going rather than wasted my time in those unnecessary self-doubts and worries.
			Fighting, Cuiting. You should learn to challenge your self.</p>
